%\cleardoublepage\phantomsection
%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\bibname}% Add references to ToC (and bookmarks)
%\printbibliography
\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc]
% Remark: heading=bibintoc adds bib in TOC and bookmarks and seems to provide a \phantomsection like facility for hyperref
%TODO: check more on heading=bibintoc option could be usefull to avoid \cleardoublepage\phantom section with TOC, LOF and LOT
